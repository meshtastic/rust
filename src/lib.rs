///
/// * `PacketDestination::Local` - This destination is used for packets that are intended to be processed locally
///     by the radio and not to be forwarded to other nodes. An example of this would be local configuration packets.
/// * `PacketDestination::Broadcast` - This destination is used for packets that are intended to be broadcast to all
///     nodes in the mesh. This is the default enum variant. Text messages are commonly broadcasted to the entire mesh.
/// * `PacketDestination::Node(u32)` - This destination is used for packets that are intended to be sent to a specific
///     node in the mesh. The `u32` value is the node id of the node that the packet should be sent to. This is commonly
///     used for direct text messages.
///
/// The `PacketRouter` trait defines the behavior of a struct that is able to route mesh packets. This trait is used
/// to allow for the echoing of mesh packets within the `send_mesh_packet` method of the `ConnectedStreamApi` struct.
///
/// The `PacketReceiver` type defines the type of the tokio channel that is used to receive decoded packets from the radio.
/// This is intended to simplify the complexity of the underlying channel type.
