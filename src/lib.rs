/// This module contains the main API for interacting with Meshtastic devices.
/// This module exposes the `StreamApi` and `ConnectedStreamApi` structs, as well
/// as helper states within the `state` module.
///
/// The user will create a new instance of the API through calling the `StreamApi::new()`
/// method. This will return a new `StreamApi` instance. The only method that is exposed
/// on this struct is the `connect` method. This is a compile-time check to force the user
/// of the library to connect to a radio before attempting to send data onto the mesh.
///
/// If successful, the `connect` method will return a tuple of the `ConnectedStreamApi`
/// instance, as well as a `PacketReceiver`. The `PacketReceiver` is a tokio channel
/// that can be used to listen to incoming packets from the radio. Since the user is now
/// connected to the radio. the resulting `ConnectedStreamApi` instance will then be able
/// to access the `configure` method, as well as some additional low-level sender methods.
///
/// The `configure` method requests the current radio configuration, will return an updated
/// instance of the `ConnectedStreamApi` struct. This resulting instance will then have access
/// to the full set of API sender methods.
///
/// To disconnect from the radio, the user can call the `disconnect` method at any time.

/// trait, and the `PacketReceiver` type.
///
/// The `PacketDestination` enum is used to define the destination of a packet. The enum defines three possible
/// destinations for packets sent to the radio by the library:
///
/// * `PacketDestination::Local` - This destination is used for packets that are intended to be processed locally
///   by the radio and not to be forwarded to other nodes. An example of this would be local configuration packets.
/// * `PacketDestination::Broadcast` - This destination is used for packets that are intended to be broadcast to all
///   nodes in the mesh. This is the default enum variant. Text messages are commonly broadcasted to the entire mesh.
/// * `PacketDestination::Node(u32)` - This destination is used for packets that are intended to be sent to a specific
///   node in the mesh. The `u32` value is the node id of the node that the packet should be sent to. This is commonly
///   used for direct text messages.
///
/// The `PacketRouter` trait defines the behavior of a struct that is able to route mesh packets. This trait is used
/// to allow for the echoing of mesh packets within the `send_mesh_packet` method of the `ConnectedStreamApi` struct.
///
/// The `PacketReceiver` type defines the type of the tokio channel that is used to receive decoded packets from the radio.
/// This is intended to simplify the complexity of the underlying channel type.
